    <h1>AMA Pro Rasing</h1>
    <p> <a href="https://www.sportbiketrackgear.com/">SportbikeTrackGear.com</a><br>
		Suzuki's Elena Myers claimed her second career AMA Pro victory in sensational fashion on Saturday at Daytona International Speedway. Her win was also the first by a woman in a professional motorsports event at the fabled venue.</p>

    <p class="no1">The 18-year-old AMA Pro SuperSport title hopeful got her revenge for Friday's race in which she fought for the win but got shuffled back in the draft on the contest's final lap. On Saturday, she altered her strategy, putting her GSX-R600 at the front of a four-rider lead pack as they raced up onto the banking for the final time.</p>
	<p class="no2"> Myers tucked into the cockpit and made herself as small as possible in the sprint to the checkered flag. The decision paid off as her rivals proved incapable of drafting by her at the stripe, with Myers scoring the win by 0.240 seconds.</p>
    <blockquote>
	<p class="column1">"I just can't thank my team enough for giving me such a great bike this weekend. They put just the greatest machine under me. I'm so happy to get a win for them. It's a great feeling and nothing compares to it. That's why come here and do what we do -- to stand on the top of the box."</p>
