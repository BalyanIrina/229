    <h1>Elena Myers</h1>
    <p>On May 15, 2010 at age 16, Elena Myers became the first woman to win an AMA Pro Racing professional motorcycle road race, at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California.
    For the teenager from Discovery Bay, California, it was a long time coming, but all part of a plan put into effect when she was 12 years old. Even then, there was something about the youngster's maturity and confidence that caught the attention of Team Hammer co-founder John Ulrich, who has made a name for himself as a man with a keen eye for spotting racing talent.</p>
    <p>Elena had already been racing for four years, having started at age eight and quickly progressing from 35cc pocketbikes to 50cc minibikes to an 80cc SuperMoto bike with the support of her parents, Matt and Anita. At age 11, Elena graduated to a 125cc Grand Prix racebike and won her first race.
    For the 2008 and 2009 seasons, Elena stepped up to racing a Roadracingworld.com-sponsored Kids: Don't Smoke! four-cylinder Kawasaki ZX-6R in 600cc WERA National Challenge Series and WERA Sportsman Series events, earning race wins and more podium finishes. And in November, 2009, Elena turned 16 years old and became eligible for an AMA Pro Racing license.</p>
    <p>In March 2010, Elena headed into her AMA Pro Racing debut at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida armed with a pair of Team Hammer-prepared Suzuki GSX-R600 racebikes fielded in collaboration with RoadracingWorld.com and Richie Morris Racing. She ran in the top five and finished seventh in both races of the AMA SuperSport double-header at Daytona. She crashed in a starting-grid collision not of her making on Saturday of the second round of the AMA Series, at Fontana, California's Auto Club Speedway, and suffered a badly bruised elbow. She rebounded to finish a strong fourth on Sunday.</p>
    <p>Life changed for Elena Myers on that historic weekend in May. Fans stood and cheered each time she went past on the track. People thronged around her in the paddock, and lined up for autographs.
    At Infineon Raceway, Elena Myers proved that dreams can come true.
    And the ride is just beginning.</p>
